// Todos:
// 1. Adjacency List - ONGOING
// 2. Adjacency Matrix
// 3. BFS for undirected graph
// 4. DFS for undirected graph
// 5. DFS for directed graph
// 5. Track discovery time and finish time - time interval = finish - discovery time
// That the amount of time it lives on the stack
// 6. Vertex with last finishing time is the root of the DFS tree
// 7. Back edges in DFS Directed graph represents a cycle
// 8. If we have a cycle we will have a back edge in dfs

// Adjacency List
